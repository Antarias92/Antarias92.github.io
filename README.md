Project Overview
This project utilizes the GIPHY API to create a search engine for GIFs. The user can type in an input field into a search bar to search for related GIFs. If the userâ€™s search input is valid, the site will access the API and display the resulting GIFs on the same page. Users will be able to click on the gifs they searched to open them in a new tab.

Technology Used: GIPHY API, html, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Google Fonts

User Stories
1.	As a presenter, I want to search up a variety of safe-for-work GIFs, so that I can include them into my presentations.
2.	As a content creator, I want to search for a lot of cat GIFs, so I can add cat GIFs to my content.
3.	As a job recruiter, I want my search queries to generate responsively, so that I can determine that the candidate understands how to utilize APIs.

Future Improvements
1.	I would like to add a tracking feature to keep track of how many times a particular word is searched.
2.	I would also like to implement the tracking feature to display the most searched GIFs on the landing page. 
3.	I would like to generate random GIFs every time the homepage is visited.
